Encryption</h2>

<p>KeePass database files are encrypted. KeePass encrypts the complete database,
i.e. not only your passwords. The user names, notes, etc. are encrypted, too.</p>

<p>Databases are encrypted using one of the following block ciphers:</p>

<center><table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>Cipher</small></th>
<th align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>Block Size</small></th>
<th align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>Key Size</small></th></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><small>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael)</small></td>
<td align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>128 bits</small></td>
<td align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>256 bits</small></td></tr>

<tr><td align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>Twofish</small></td>
<td align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>128 bits</small></td>
<td align="left" nowrap="nowrap"><small>256 bits</small></td></tr>

</table></center>

<p>These algorithms are well-known, analyzed thoroughly and
considered to be very secure (see
<a href="#secref">[1]</a>
for comments by the NIST on AES for example).
AES e.g. became effective as a U.S. Federal government standard
and is approved by the National Security Agency (NSA)
for top secret information.</p>


KeePass 2.x doesn't support Twofish, but additional encryption algorithms
can be provided by plugins.


<p>The block ciphers are used in the CBC (cipher-block chaining)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation"
target="_blank" rel="nofollow">block cipher mode</a>.
In CBC mode, plaintext patterns are concealed.</p>

<p>For both algorithms, a 128-bit initialization vector (IV) is generated randomly
each time you save the database. This allows multiple databases to be encrypted using
the same key without observable patterns being revealed.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_password.png" class="singleimg" alt="Key" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hashing
and Key Derivation</h2>

<p>In order to generate the 256-bit key for the block ciphers, the Secure Hash
Algorithm SHA-256 is used. This algorithm compresses
the <i>user key</i> provided by the user (consisting of password and/or key file)
to a fixed-size key of 256 bits. This transformation is one-way, i.e. it is
computationally infeasible to invert the hash function or find a second message
that compresses to the same hash.</p>

<p>The recently discovered attack against SHA-1
<a href="#secref">[2]</a> doesn't affect the security
of SHA-256. SHA-256 is still considered as being very secure
<a href="#secref">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Key Derivation:</b><br />
If only a password is used (i.e. no key file), the password plus a 128-bit
random <i>salt</i> are hashed using SHA-256 to form the final key (but note there is
some preprocessing: <a href="#secdictprotect">Protection against Dictionary
Attacks</a>). The random salt prevents attacks that are based on pre-computed hashes.</p>

<p>When using both password <i>and</i> key file, the final key is
derived as follows: <code>SHA-256(SHA-256(password), key file contents)</code>, i.e.
the hash of the master password is concatenated with the key file bytes and
the resulting byte string is hashed with SHA-256 again. If the key file doesn't
contain exactly 32 bytes (256 bits), they are hashed with SHA-256, too, to form
a 256-bit key. The formula above then changes to: <code>SHA-256(SHA-256(password),
SHA-256(key file contents))</code>.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_binary.png" class="singleimg" alt="Binary" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Random
Number Generation</h2>

<p>KeePass needs to generate several random bytes (for the IV, the master key salt,
etc.). For this,
several pseudo-random sources are used: current tick count, performance counter,
system date/time, mouse cursor position, memory status (free virtual memory,
etc.), active window, clipboard owner, various process and thread IDs, various window
handles (active window, desktop, ...), window message stack, process heap
status, process startup information and several system information structures.
Additionally, KeePass uses random bytes provided by the system's default CSP RNG.</p>

<p>This pseudo-random data is collected in a random pool. To generate 16 random bytes,
the pool is hashed (SHA-256) with a counter. The
counter is increased after 16 generated bytes. This way,
as many secure random bytes can be produced efficiently as needed.</p>

<br />

<a name="secdictprotect"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_password.png" class="singleimg" alt="Key" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection
against Dictionary Attacks</h2>

<p>KeePass supports a protection against guessing and dictionary attacks.</p>

<p>You can't really prevent these attacks:
nothing prevents an attacker to just try
all possible keys and look if the database decrypts. But what we can do (and
KeePass does) is to make it harder: by adding a constant work factor to the
key initialization, we can make them as hard as we want.</p>

<p>To generate the
final 256-bit key that is used for the block cipher, KeePass first hashes the
user's password using SHA-256, encrypts the result <i>N</i> times using the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) algorithm (called <i>key transformation rounds</i> from on now),
and then hashes it again using SHA-256. For AES, a random
256-bit key is used, which is stored in the database file. As the AES transformations
aren't pre-computable (key is random), an attacker has to perform all the encryptions, too, otherwise
he cannot try and see if the current key is correct.</p>

<p>An attacker now needs much more time to try a key. If he can only try
a few keys per second, a dictionary attack is not practical anymore.
<i>N</i> is a work factor, only indirectly a time factor. A super computer
can try a key a lot faster than a standard PC, but anyway testing one key
with <i>N</i> transformation rounds will take <i>N</i> times longer than
trying a key with no transformation rounds on the super computer.</p>

<p>By default, KeePass
sets <i>N</i> to 6000 encryption rounds (full encryptions are meant; <i>N</i> has nothing
to do with the internal encryption rounds of AES). This number has been chosen
in order to
provide compatibility with portable device versions (PocketPC processors are slower,
therefore the key computation takes longer).</p>

<p>If you are using KeePass on PC only, it is highly recommended to increase the number
of key transformation rounds. You can change the number in the database options dialog.
Right of the field for the rounds, you'll find a button. When clicking this button, KeePass
computes the rounds number that leads to a 1-second delay. Waiting 1 second at database
opening isn't a problem, but for an attacker of course it is. But, the number can be
freely set to a number of your choice; the button only should give you a rough idea how many
rounds can be computed in 1 second on your computer.</p>

<p>This protection feature is only useful for master passwords; key files are random anyway,
there's no need to transform the key file contents. Guessing the key file contents is equally hard to
a brute-force attack on the final key.</p>

<p>KeePass uses multithreading to compute the transformations (the master key is split
up to two parts of 128 bits, which is the AES block size). On dual/multi core
processors, the computation can be twice as fast
as on a single core processor. <!-- Note the 1-second button in the database
settings dialog always shows the single core rounds number (the dual/multi
core optimization only affects the &quot;real&quot; transformation code,
not the benchmark). --></p>

<p>On Windows Vista and higher, KeePass can use Windows' CNG/BCrypt API
for the key transformations, which is about 50% faster than the KeePass
built-in key transformation code.</p>

<p><b>KeePassX:</b> In contrast to KeePass, the Linux port project 'KeePassX'
only partially supports protection against dictionary and guessing attacks.</p>

<img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" class="singleimg"
alt="Application Protection" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Process Memory Protection</h2>

<p>While KeePass is running, sensitive data (like the hash of the master key and
entry passwords) is stored encrypted in process memory.</p>

<p>This means that even if you would dump the KeePass process memory to disk,
you couldn't find the passwords.</p>

<!-- By default, entry passwords are in-memory protected, the other fields not
(like in 1.x). However, you can turn on in-memory protection for other fields
in the database settings dialog (not recommended though, because of
performance reasons). -->

<p>For example, when you are copying a password to the clipboard, KeePass
first decrypts the password field, copies it to the clipboard
and immediately re-encrypts it using the random key.</p>

<p>Additionally, KeePass erases all security-critical memory when it's not
needed anymore, i.e. it overwrites these memory areas before releasing them
(this applies to all security-critical memory, not only the password fields).</p>

<p>KeePass &ge; 1.15 and 2.x use the Windows DPAPI for in-memory encrypting the
sensitive data. With DPAPI, the key for in-memory encryption is stored in a
secure, non-swappable memory area managed by Windows.
If DPAPI is not available or disabled (advanced KeePass options, by default
using DPAPI is enabled), KeePass uses the ARC4 encryption algorithm with a random
<!-- 12 bytes long --> key. Note that this is less secure than DPAPI, mainly <i>not</i>
because ARC4 cryptographically isn't that strong, but because the key for in-memory
encryption is also stored in swappable process memory.</p>

Master Key on Secure Desktop (Protection against Keyloggers)</h2>

<p><i>Note: KeePass was one of the first (maybe even the first) password
manager that allows entering the master key on a secure desktop!</i></p>

<p>KeePass 2.x has an option (in 'Tools' -&gt; 'Options' -&gt; tab 'Security')
to show the master key dialog on a secure desktop
(supported on Windows &ge; 2000), similar to Windows'
User Account Control (UAC). Almost no keylogger works on a secure desktop.</p>

<p>The option is disabled by default for compatibility reasons.</p>


Note that auto-type can be secured against keyloggers, too, by using
<a href="../v2/autotype_obfuscation.html">Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation</a>.

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_password.png" class="singleimg" alt="Key" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Locking
the Workspace</h2>

<p>When locking the workspace, KeePass closes the
database file and only remembers the last view settings (which group and entries were
selected, list position, etc.).</p>

<p>This provides maximum security: unlocking the
workspace is as hard as opening the database file the normal way. Also, it prevents
data-loss (the computer can crash while KeePass is locked, without doing any damage
to the database).</p>

<p>Each time you start KeePass, the program performs a quick self-test to see
whether the block ciphers and the hash algorithms work correctly and pass
their test-vectors. If one of the algorithms doesn't pass its test vectors,
KeePass shows a security exception message box.</p>

<img src="../images/b16x16_openterm.png" class="singleimg" alt="Terminal" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized
Spyware</h2>

<p>This section gives answers to questions like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would encrypting the configuration file increase security by preventing
changes by a malicious program?</li>
<li>Would encrypting the application (executable file, eventually together
with the configuration file) increase security by preventing changes
by a malicious program?</li>
<li>Would an option to prevent plugins from being loaded increase security?</li>
<li>Would storing security options in the database (to override the settings of
the KeePass instance) increase security?</li>
<li>Would locking the main window in such a way that only auto-type is allowed
increase security?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer to all these questions is: no. Adding any of these features
would not increase security.</p>

<p>All security features in KeePass protect against <i>generic</i> threats like
keyloggers, clipboard monitors, password control monitors, etc. (and against
non-runtime attacks on the database, memory dump analyzers, ...).
However in all the questions above we're assuming that there's a spyware
program running on the system that's specialized on attacking KeePass.</p>

<p>In this situation, the best security features will fail.
This is law #1 of the
10 Immutable Laws of Security <a href="#secref">[4]</a> <a href="#secref">[5]</a>:
<i>&quot;If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your
computer, it's not your computer anymore&quot;</i>.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following very simple spyware specialized
for KeePass: an application that waits for KeePass to be started, then hides
the started application and imitates KeePass itself. All interactions
(like entering a password for decrypting the configuration, etc.) can be
simulated.
The only way to discover this spyware is to use a program that the spyware
doesn't know about or can't manipulate (secure desktop);
in any case it can't be KeePass.</p>
